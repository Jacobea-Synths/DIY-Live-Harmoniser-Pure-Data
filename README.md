# DIY-Live-Harmoniser-Pure-Data
This is a live harmoniser in vanilla pure data with four voices. All you need is a midi keyboard, a mic, and preferably an audio interface.

It is very jank. If you have suggestions of how to do it better let me know, but don't diss pls I'm an amateur. It should work straight away, except you need to pull up the volume on the sliders in the bottom middle. Haven't labelled anything, I barely understand how it works so I can't make it more palatable to other users looool.
